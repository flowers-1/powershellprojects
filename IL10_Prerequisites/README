IL10 Prerequisites for App Server installation

These sets of scripts are intended to supplement the Windows installer and handle the configuration of the prerequisites for the App Server. These
prerequisites are as follows:

  1. Installation and configuration of the Apache Tomcat package;
  2. Configuration of the Oracle Java platform;
  3. Configuration of the Java environment variables for the system;

These scripts are made to prevent human error on the client-side when installing and configuring the program for the first time.
