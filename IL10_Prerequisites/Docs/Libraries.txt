About Function_Libraries

The Function Libraries that are included with the script package are custom functions that can be called within other scripts once they are initialized. Currently, the functions are separated into individual files for ease of development and editing. The functions included in the library are as follows:

  1. Get-Software
  2. Filter-SoftwareOutput
  3. Download-Requirements
  4. Test-IsAdmin

For specific details on each of the functions, please refer to the "Functions" documentation located at .\Docs\Functions.txt
