###### IL10 Prerequisites for App Server installation

prerequisites are as follows:

  1. Installation and configuration of the Apache Tomcat package;
  2. Installation and Configuration of the Oracle Java platform;
  3. Configuration of the Java environment variables for the system.

The purpose of these scripts are to prevent human-error and reduce the technical knowledge burden that some of the installation could cause.
